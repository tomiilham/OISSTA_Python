README for NNVL OISST Anomaly image re-projection

Abstract:
The scripts are contained in this project re-project NNVL OISST Anomaly
CED images onto a map (Hammer-Aitoff, equidistant cylindrical, 
or Robinson). The source images currently reside at:

Monthly OISSTA: ftp://ftp.nnvl.noaa.gov/View/SSTA/Images/Color/Monthly/
Annual OISSTA: ftp://ftp.nnvl.noaa.gov/View/ANOM/Images/Color/Yearly/


Program Usage:

The program oisstamaindriver.py will download the latest (previous month) CED image from the
NNVL ftp site, process all of the DS maps, and upload them to the AWS server. Alternatively, this driver
can also be used to process any month by simply passing in a date string as an argument of the form:
"201603" 


Software and Dependencies:

The scripts included here were built for Python 2.7. The following
modules must exist on the system for them to perform correctly:

matplotlib-1.1.1 (or higher)
PIL (python imaging library, 1.1.7 or higher, PIL is the Python Imaging Library)
mpl_toolkits.basemap
numpy
urllib
shapefile
sys
os
subprocess
time
matplotlib.font_manager (in order to utilize the true type font MS Trebuchet, which is not
	included as a "base" font in python*)
	*The usage of PIL and the font manager inside matplotlib in these scripts requires
	the ability to utilize true type fonts. As such for example on a linux box, one would
	need to have installed the freetype-dev packages. Specifically, libfreetype6-dev needs
	to be installed on ubuntu... 

Other files in this project:
colorbar and logo (.png and .eps) files included here are sized for each of the image 
sizes and are used by the various python scripts that produce the reprojected images



Notes on portability:

1) All image making scripts in the project need the path to Trebuchet MS true-type font.
e.g.,

	/usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts/Trebuchet_MS.ttf

	*This path depends entirely on the location the sysadmin installs “add-on” fonts.

2) The two mapping routines (oissta_monthly_map.py and oissta_yearly_map.py) require the path
to the original images, e.g., 

	 /NNVL_OISSTA/Images/Monthly/Orig
